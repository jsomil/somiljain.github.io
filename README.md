# Research Method (DS200)

This repository is dedicated to the Module 4 of the DS200.


## Environment used
1. Python 3 is used for completing this assignment.
2. All experiments are performed in the google colab and can be regenerated.
3. Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.


## How to run
1. Download the zipfile and run ResearchMethod_M4.ipynb on google colab or jupyter notebook and there is also a python researchmethod_m4.py file available.

## Dataset 
The data is also available publicly at <https://data.gov.in>. This is the Rainfall data from 1901-2017 based on states, months and annually and all the pllots are made using this dataset. 

## Sub Divisional Monthly Rainfall from 1901 to 2017 in India

**a. Scatter Plot**

![Amount of Rainfall vs Years(from 1901-2017)](images/rainfall_months_all.png)

**Observation:** The scatter plot above shows the comparision between the different season of months based on the amount of rainfall. So we can easily conclude that June and July month have more rain than other.


**b. Box Plot**

![Annual rainfall vs year(2011-2017)](images/box_plot.png)

**Observation:**  This plot show the annual rainfall in india from the year 2011 to 2017 and how it's varies across different regions. The observation is the average annual rainfall is almost same but their are few outliers having low and high rain in a region.

**c.1 Line Plot**

![Cumulative rainfall for Lakshadweep](images/line_plot_cum_laks.png)

**Observation:** The line plot shows the cumulative line plot for the Lakshadweep Union territory from 1901 to 2017 and it is observed that June have the most rainfall and March have the least rainfall in the territory.

**c.2 Line Plot**

![Cumulative rainfall for India](images/line_plot_cum_all.png)
